# Simple Icons

## Want to contribute?

1. Find an official source vector image.
2. Use your SVG editor of choice to produce a monochrome icon (with a view to keeping the file size as small as possible).
3. Optimize the SVG using SVGO and add it to the `/icons` directory.
4. Add an entry to `/src/simple-icons.json` with:
   - The icon title
   - The HEX colour value
   - The URL of the source vector image (or the page itâ€™s available at)
