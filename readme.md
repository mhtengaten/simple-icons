## Feedback and Requests

If you have a specific request—or a comment—create an <a href="https://github.com/danleech/simple-icons/issues">Issue</a> on this repository. Icons will be added over time, and existing ones may be updated.

### Vector (SVG / webfont) versions

This is definitely something I’d like to include, but it’ll require me to take some time off work to complete. Hopefully that will happen sometime this summer. Watch this space!
