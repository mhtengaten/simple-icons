## Requesting an Icon

We welcome icon requests. Before you submit a new issue please make sure the icon:

* Has not already been requested. If you find an existing issue or pull request for the brand you're looking for then please add a reaction or comment to show your support.
* Is of a _popular_ brand. For websites, the [Alexa rank](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo) should be less than 500k. For anything else, popularity will be judged on a case-by-case basis.
* Isn't related to anything that provides an illegal service (e.g. piracy, malware, threatening material, spam, etc.).

If you are in doubt, feel free to submit it and we'll have a look.

When submitting a request for a new or updated icon include helpful information such as:

* **Issue Title:** The brand name. For example:
  * New Icons: `Request: GitHub Icon`
  * Icon Updates: `Update: GitHub Color` or `Update: GitHub Icon`

* **Issue Body:** Links to official sources for the brand's icon and colors (e.g. media kits, brand guidelines, SVG files etc.)

If you have an affiliation to the brand you are requesting that allows you to speak on their behalf then please disclose that in your issue as it can help speed up our research process.

## Adding or Updating an Icon

**Note**: If you decide to add an icon without requesting it first, the requirements above still apply.

### 1. Identify Official Logos and Colors

Most of the icons and brand colors on SimpleIcons have been derived from official sources. Using official sources helps ensure that the icons and colors in SimpleIcons accurately match the brand they represent. Thankfully, this is usually a simple process as organizations often provide brand guides and high quality versions of their logo for download.

Official high quality brand logos and brand colors can usually be found in the following locations:

1. About pages, Press pages, Media Kits, and Brand Guidelines.
1. Website headers (you can use [svg-grabber](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/svg-grabber-get-all-the-s/ndakggdliegnegeclmfgodmgemdokdmg) for Chrome)
1. Favicons
1. Wikimedia (which should provide a source)
1. GitHub repositories

Working with an SVG version of the logo is best. In the absence of an SVG version, other vector filetypes may work as well (e.g. EPS, AI, PDF). In the absence of vector logos, a vector can be created from a high quality rasterized image, however this is much more labor intensive.

For color, the brand's primary color should be used. The official color of a brand is usually found in their brand guidelines, media kits, or some of the other locations mentioned above. If no official color can be identified, use the brand's primary web color or the most prominent color in the logo itself (please indicate why you choose the particular color in your pull request). Simple Icons stores brand colors in the standard 6 character hexadecimal format.

### 2. Extract the Icon from the Logo

There are many different tools for editing SVG files, some options include:

| Name | Description | Platform | Price |
| :---- | :---- | :----: | :----: |
| [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) | Vector Graphics Editor | Windows, Mac, Linux | Free |
| [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/de/designer/) | Vector Graphics Editor | Windows, Mac | $ |
| [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) | Vector Graphics Editor | Windows, Mac | $ - $$$ |
| [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) | Icon Editing/Management Tool | Online | Free |

Using your preferred tool you should:

1. Isolate the icon from any text or extraneous items.
1. Merge any overlapping paths.
1. Compound all paths into one.
1. Change the icon's viewbox/canvas/page size to 24x24.
1. Scale the icon to fit the viewbox, while preserving the icon's original proportions. This means the icon should be touching at least two sides of the viewbox.
1. Center the icon horizontally and vertically.
1. Remove all colors. The icon should be monochromatic.
1. Export the icon as an SVG.

### 3. Optimize the Icon

All icons in Simple Icons have been optimized with the [SVGO tool](https://github.com/svg/svgo). This can be done in one of two ways:

* The [SVGO Command Line Tool](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
  * Install dependencies
    * With npm: `npm install` from the root of this repository
  * Run the following command `npm run svgo -- icons/file-to-optimize.svg`
  * Check if there is a loss of quality in the output, if so increase the precision.
* The [SVGOMG Online Tool](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
  * Click "Open SVG" and select an SVG file.
  * Set the precision to about 3, depending on if there is a loss of quality.
  * Leave the remaining settings untouched (or reset them with the button at the bottom of the settings).
  * Click the download button.
* The [SVGO Command Line Tool](https://github.com/svg/svgo) in Docker
  * If none of the options above work for you, it is possible to build a Docker image for compressing the images.
  * Build: `docker build . -t simple-icons`
  * Run: `docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/icons/file-to-optimize.svg:/image.svg simple-icons`

After optimizing the icon, double-check it against your original version to ensure no visual imperfections have crept in. Also make sure that the dimensions of the path have not been changed so that the icon no longer fits exactly within the canvas. We currently check the dimensions up to a precision of 3 decimal points.

### 4. Annotate the Icon

Each icon in Simple Icons has been annotated with a number of attributes and elements to increase accessibility. These include:

* An svg element with:
  * An img role attribute.
    * `role="img"`
  * A 24x24 viewbox.
    * `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`
  * The svg namespace.
    * `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`
* A title element (Note the format).
  * `<title>Adobe Photoshop icon</title>`

Here is _part of_ the svg for the Adobe Photoshop icon as an example:

```svg
<svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Adobe Photoshop icon</title>...</svg>
```

### 5. Check the Icon

The final icon should:

* Be properly annotated [as discussed above](#4-annotate-the-icon).
* Be monochromatic.
  * Remove all fill colors so that icon defaults to black.
* Be scaled to fit the viewbox, while preserving the icon's original proportions.
  * This means the icon should be touching at least two sides of the viewbox.
* Be vertically and horizontally centered.
* Be minified to a single line with no formatting.
* Contain only a single `path` element.
* Not contain extraneous elements.
  * This includes: `circ`, `ellipse`, `rect`, `polygon`, `line`, `g`, etc.
* Not contain extraneous attributes.
  * This includes: `width`, `height`, `fill`, `stroke`, `clip`, `font`, etc.

Here is the svg for the Adobe Photoshop icon as an example:

```svg
<svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Adobe Photoshop icon</title><path d="M0 .3v23.4h24V.3H0zm1 1h22v21.4H1V1.3zm4.8 4.48c0-.067.14-.116.224-.116.644-.033 1.588-.05 2.578-.05 2.772 0 3.85 1.52 3.85 3.466 0 2.54-1.842 3.63-4.102 3.63-.38 0-.51-.017-.775-.017v3.842c0 .083-.033.116-.115.116H5.916c-.083 0-.115-.03-.115-.113V5.78zm1.775 5.312c.23.016.412.016.81.016 1.17 0 2.27-.412 2.27-1.996 0-1.27-.786-1.914-2.122-1.914-.396 0-.775.016-.957.033v3.864zm8.607-1.188c-.792 0-1.056.396-1.056.726 0 .363.18.61 1.237 1.155 1.568.76 2.062 1.485 2.062 2.557 0 1.6-1.22 2.46-2.87 2.46-.876 0-1.62-.183-2.05-.43-.065-.033-.08-.082-.08-.165V14.74c0-.1.048-.133.114-.084.624.413 1.352.594 2.012.594.792 0 1.122-.33 1.122-.776 0-.363-.23-.677-1.237-1.205-1.42-.68-2.014-1.37-2.014-2.527 0-1.287 1.006-2.36 2.755-2.36.86 0 1.464.132 1.794.28.082.05.1.132.1.198v1.37c0 .083-.05.133-.15.1-.444-.264-1.1-.43-1.743-.43z"/></svg>
```

### 6. Update the JSON Data for SimpleIcons.org

Icon metadata should be added to the `_data/simple-icons.json` file. Each icon in the array has three required values:

  * The `title` of the new SVG.
  * A `hex` color value that matches the brand's primary color. All uppercase and without the `#` pound symbol.)
  * The `source` URL of the logo being used. There are [more details below](#source-guidelines).

Here is the object for The Movie Database as an example:

```json
{
    "title": "The Movie Database",
    "hex": "01D277",
    "source": "https://www.themoviedb.org/about/logos-attribution"
}
```

Make sure the icon is added in alphabetical order. If you're in doubt, you can always run `npm run our-lint` - this will tell you if any of the JSON data is in the wrong order.

#### SVG Filename Convention

The filename of the SVG should correspond to the `title` used in the JSON file mentioned above, and it should follow the rules below. If you're in doubt, you can always run `npm run get-filename -- Brand name` to get the correct filename.

1. Use **lowercase letters** without **whitespace**, for example:

    ```yml
    title: Adobe Photoshop
    filename: adobephotoshop.svg
    ```

1. Only use **latin** letters, for example:

    ```yml
    title: CitroÃ«n
    filename: citroen.svg
    ```

1. Replace the following symbols with their alias depending on their position in the title:

    | Symbol | Start | Middle | End  |
    | :----: | ----- | ------ | ---- |
    |   +    | plus  | plus   | plus |
    |   .    | dot-  | -dot-  | -dot |
    |   &    | and-  | -and-  | -and |

    for example:

    ```yml
    title: .Net
    filename: dot-net.svg
    ```

#### Source Guidelines

We use the source URL as a reference for the current SVG in our repository and as a jumping-off point to find updates if the logo changes. If you used one of the sources listed below, make sure to follow these guidelines. If you're unsure about the source URL you can open a Pull Request and ask for help from others.

If the SVG is sourced from:

- **Branding page**: For an SVG from a branding page the source URL should simply link to the branding page.
- **Company website**: If the SVG is found on the company website (but there is no branding page) the source URL should link to a common page, such as the home page or about page, that includes the source material.
- **GitHub**: For an SVG from a GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) repository the source URL should link to the file that was used as source material. If the color comes from another file in the repository the URL should link to the repository itself.

  In any case the commit hash should be part of the URL. On GitHub, you can get the correct URL by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> on the GitHub page you want to link to. You can get help at the [getting permanent links to files page](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/getting-permanent-links-to-files).

- **Wikipedia**: For an SVG from Wikipedia/Wikimedia the source URL should link to the logo file's page on the relevant site, and not the brand's Wikipedia pages. For example, [this is the link for AmericanExpress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American_Express_logo.svg).

In general, make sure the URL does not contain any tracking identifiers.

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Once you've completed the previous steps, create a pull request to merge your edits into the *develop* branch. You can run `npm run lint` to check if there are any issues you still need to address.

If you have an affiliation to the brand you contributing that allows you to speak on their behalf then please disclose that in your pull request as it can help speed up our research and review processes.
